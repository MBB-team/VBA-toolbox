Dear VBA users, you are not mistaken: this used to be the link for the VBA forum, which was operated by MUUT. However, MUUT has stopped responding sometime during the year 2024, without warning. This unfortunately means that the contents of the (quite broad and lively) forum discussions were lost. We are really sorry about this and are actively looking for a replacement solution. We will also try to summarize some of the main points raised during these exchanges. We'll keep you posted!
