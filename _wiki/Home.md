# How to use VBA

## Some statistical theory

- [Bayesian inference: introduction](Bayesian-modelling-introduction)
- [The variational Bayes approach](The-variational-Bayesian-approach)
- [VBA: structure of the generative model](Structure-of-VBA's-generative-model)

## Getting Started with VBA

- [VBA: model inversion in 4 steps](VBA-model-inversion-in-4-steps)
- [VBA: a fast demo (Q-learning)](Fast-demo-Q-learning-model)
- [VBA: graphical output](VBA-graphical-output)

## What VBA users cannot ignore

- [VBA: results and diagnostics](VBA-output-structure)
- [VBA: controlling the inversion options](Controlling-the-inversion-using-VBA-options)
- [10 simple rules for VBA](10-simple-rules)
- [Identifiability and confusion analyses](identifiability)


## Advanced VBA tricks

- [Experimental design optimization](Optimizing-the-experimental-design)
- [Multisession inversions](Multisession)
- [Mixed observations (including multinomial and gaussian variables)](Multisources)
- [Bayesian model selection for group studies](BMS-for-group-studies)
- [Bayesian model selection with large model spaces](Comparing-large-spaces-of-models)
- [Volterra decompositions](Volterra-decomposition)
- [Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)](VBA-BMA)
- [Setting the priors through Empirical Bayes](VBA-MFX)
- [Setting "hard constraints" through parameter transformations](param-transform)

- [Extending VBA's generative model (for power-users only)](generativeModels)


# Library of models

> The VBA-toolbox already includes a large library of plug-and-play models. Below, we give a few examples of such models. We briefly expose the main theoretical and experimental issues, and point to the relevant VBA functions (demonstration scripts, evolution/observation functions, etc...). Note that this list is by no means exhaustive: users are invited to look for demonstration scripts in VBA's `\subfunctions` folder.

### Behavioural/cognitive models

- [Reinforcement learning](Reinforcement-learning)
- [Bayesian associative learning (including, e.g., volatile systems)](bayesian-learning)
- [Bayesian sequence learning (BSL)](BSL)
- [Bayesian mentalizing (k-ToM)](ktom)
- [Bi-dimensional decisions (e.g., inter-temporal choices)](intertemporal-choice)
